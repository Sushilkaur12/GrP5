Learning outcomes of the project:

1.Comprehending Data: It's essential to grasp the dataset thoroughly before diving into analysis or modeling. This includes gaining an understanding of its structure, contents, and overall quality.

2.Data Prep and Initial Analysi: This phase involves cleaning and preprocessing the data to ready it for analysis and modeling. Employing fundamental analysis methods aids in gaining initial insights into the data's attributes and distributions.

3.Dataset Prep for Model Training: Preparing the dataset for model training requires additional preprocessing steps like selecting features, encoding categorical variables, and dividing the data into training and testing subsets

4. Model Training: Training the model involves selecting an appropriate machine learning algorithm, fitting it to the training data, and fine-tuning its parameters to enhance performance.

5. Performance Assessment: Assessing the trained model's performance using suitable metrics is crucial for gauging its effectiveness and pinpointing areas for enhancement.

6. New Data Prediction: Once the model is trained and evaluated, it becomes capable of making predictions on fresh, unseen data. This stage demonstrates the model's ability to generalize to real-world scenarios.

7.Model Preservation: Storing the trained model in a file (pickling) allows for its reuse without necessitating retraining, streamlining deployment and scalability.

Overall Learning Objectives:
- Understanding the complete workflow of a machine learning project, spanning from data comprehension to model deployment.
- Developing proficiency in data preprocessing techniques, model selection, and evaluation methodologies.
